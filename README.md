# Welcome to the Teaching Tool Project!

## Description

My name is Rose McCormack, and I wanted to create a conceptual tool to teach people outside
of computer science about data structures, types of algorithms, and their application. This
tool will allow people to determine which data structure or algorithm they want to learn, 
along with their respective applications. I hope to implement Java and general programming
concepts I learn over time in this project. If you want to collaborate, my Instagram is 
@codewithrose04. Thank you, and have a wonderful day. :heart::rainbow::transgender_flag:
